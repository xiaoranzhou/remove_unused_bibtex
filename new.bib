  abstract = "Root hydraulic properties play a central role in the global water
              cycle, in agricultural systems productivity, and in ecosystem
              survival as they impact the canopy water supply. However, the
              existing experimental methods to quantify root hydraulic
              conductivities, such as the root pressure probing, are
              particularly challenging, and their applicability to thin roots
              and small root segments is limited. Therefore, there is a gap in
              methods enabling easy estimations of root hydraulic
              conductivities in diverse root types. Here, we present a new
              pipeline to quickly estimate root hydraulic conductivities across
              different root types, at high resolution along root axes.
              Shortly, free-hand root cross-sections were used to extract a
              selected number of key anatomical traits. We used these traits to
              parametrize the Generator of Root Anatomy in R (GRANAR) model to
              simulate root anatomical networks. Finally, we used these
              generated anatomical networks within the Model of Explicit
              Cross-section Hydraulic Anatomy (MECHA) to compute an estimation
              of the root axial and radial hydraulic conductivities (k x and k
              r , respectively). Using this combination of anatomical data and
              computational models, we were able to create a root hydraulic
              conductivity atlas at the root system level, for 14-day-old
              pot-grown Zea mays (maize) plants of the var. B73. The altas
              highlights the significant functional variations along and
              between different root types. For instance, predicted variations
              of radial conductivity along the root axis were strongly
              dependent on the maturation stage of hydrophobic barriers. The
              same was also true for the maturation rates of the metaxylem
              vessels. Differences in anatomical traits along and across root
              types generated substantial variations in radial and axial
              conductivities estimated with our novel approach. Our
              methodological pipeline combines anatomical data and
              computational models to turn root cross-section images into a
              detailed hydraulic atlas. It is an inexpensive, fast, and easily
              applicable investigation tool for root hydraulics that
              complements existing complex experimental methods. It opens the
              way to high-throughput studies on the functional importance of
              root types in plant hydraulics, especially if combined with novel

              plant growth, the potential contribution of carbon-transporting
              tissue (phloem) remains virtually unexplored. Here, we use data
              from 347 woody plant species to investigate whether
              species-specific stem diameter growth rates can be predicted by
              the diameter of both the xylem and phloem conducting cells when
              corrected for phylogenetic relatedness. We found positive
              correlations between growth rate, phloem sieve element diameter
              and xylem vessel diameter in liana species sampled in the field.
              Moreover, we obtained similar results for data extracted from the

              Subsequently, we combined anatomical and geoclimatic data to
              train an artificial neural network to predict growth rates. Our

               temperature or water content, which in turn affects root growth.
               We investigated the effects of all soil properties combined on
               root development in the field using both experiments and
               modeling. Field experiments were carried out in rhizotron
               facilities during two consecutive growing seasons (wheat
               [Triticum aestivum L.] and maize [Zea mays L.]) in silty loam
               soils with high (>50\%) and low (<4\%) stone contents. We
               extended the CPlantBox root architecture model to explicitly
               consider the presence of stones and simulated root growth on the
               plot scale over the whole vegetation period. We found that a
               linear increase of stone content resulted in a linear decrease
               of rooting depth across all stone contents and developmental
               stages considered, whereas rooting depth was only sensitive to
               cracks below a certain crack density and at earlier growth
               stages. Moreover, the impact of precipitation-influenced soil
               strength had a relatively stronger impact on simulated root

              elongation is maintained at well-watered rates under severe water

              to vary as a function of tree height, decreasing hydraulic
              resistance as the transport pathway lengthens. However, little is
              known about ontogenetic patterns of sieve element scaling. Here
              we examine within a single species (Quercus rubra) how decreases
              in hydraulic resistance with distance from the plant apex are
              mediated by overall plant size. METHODS: We sampled and imaged
              phloem tissue at multiple heights along the main stem and in the
              live crown of four size classes of trees using fluorescence and
              scanning electron microscopy. Sieve element length and radius,
              the number of sieve areas per compound plate, pore number, and
              pore radius were used to calculate total hydraulic resistance at
              each sampling location. RESULTS: Sieve element length varied with
              tree size, while sieve element radius, sieve pore radius, and the
              number of sieve areas per compound plate varied with sampling
              position. When data from all size classes were aggregated, all
              four variables followed a power-law trend with distance from the
              top of the tree. The net effect of these ontogenetic scalings was
              to make total hydraulic sieve tube resistance independent of tree
              height from 0.5 to over 20 m. CONCLUSIONS: Sieve element
              development responded to two pieces of information, tree size and
              distance from the apex, in a manner that conserved total sieve
              tube resistance across size classes. A further differentiated

               high stone content also affects soil properties such as
               temperature or water content, which in turn affects root growth.
               We investigated the effects of all soil properties combined on
               root development in the field using both experiments and
               modeling. Field experiments were carried out in rhizotron
               facilities during two consecutive growing seasons (wheat
               [Triticum aestivum L.] and maize [Zea mays L.]) in silty loam
               soils with high (>50\%) and low (<4\%) stone contents. We
               extended the CPlantBox root architecture model to explicitly
               consider the presence of stones and simulated root growth on the
               plot scale over the whole vegetation period. We found that a
               linear increase of stone content resulted in a linear decrease
               of rooting depth across all stone contents and developmental
               stages considered, whereas rooting depth was only sensitive to
               cracks below a certain crack density and at earlier growth
               stages. Moreover, the impact of precipitation-influenced soil
               strength had a relatively stronger impact on simulated root
               arrival curves during the vegetation periods than soil
               temperature. Resulting differences between stony and non-stony
               soil of otherwise the same crop and weather conditions show
               similar trends as the differences observed in the rhizotron
               facilities. The combined belowground effects resulted in
               differences in characteristic root system measures of up to
               48\%. In future work, comparison of absolute values will require
               including shoot effects?in particular, different carbon

               containing a 'collaboration' axis in addition to the classical
               fast-slow 'conservation' axis. This collaboration axis spans
               from thin and highly branched roots that employ a
               'do-it-yourself' strategy to thick and sparsely branched roots
               that 'outsource' nutrient uptake to symbiotic arbuscular

               end, we developed a novel functional-structural plant (FSP)

               nutrients in the presence or absence of AMF. Our simulation
               results support the notion that in the absence of AMF, plants
               rely on thin, highly branched roots for their nutrient uptake.
               The presence of AMF, however, promotes thick, unbranched roots
               as an alternative strategy for uptake of immobile phosphorus,
               but not for mobile nitrogen. This provides further support for a

              The relationships between both multiscale topology and geometry

              contain redundant information. This redundancy is expressed as

              stress is one of the most adverse factors of plant growth and
              productivity. Understanding the biochemical and molecular
              responses to drought is essential for a holistic perception of
              plant resistance mechanisms to water-limited conditions. Drought
              stress progressively decreases CO2 assimilation rates due to
              reduced stomatal conductance. Drought stress also induces
              reduction in the contents and activities of photosynthetic carbon

              ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. The critical

              membrane phospholipids to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), a
              secondary signaling molecule, has been proposed to function in
              diverse plant stress responses. Both PLD and PA play key roles in
              plant growth, development, and cellular processes. PLD was
              suggested to mediate the regulation of stomatal movements by
              abscisic acid (ABA) as a response to water deficit. In this
              research, we characterized the roles of the cucumber
              phospholipase D alpha gene (CsPLD$\alpha$, GenBank accession
              number EF363796) in the growth and tolerance of transgenic
              tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) to drought stress. RESULTS: The
              CsPLD$\alpha$ overexpression in tobacco lines correlated with the
              ABA synthesis and metabolism, regulated the rapid stomatal
              closure in drought stress, and reduced the water loss. The
              NtNCED1 expression levels in the transgenic lines and wild type
              (WT) were sharply up-regulated after 16 days of drought stress
              compared with those before treatment, and the expression level in
              the transgenic lines was significantly higher than that in the
              WT. The NtAOG expression level evidently improved after 8 and 16
              days compared with that at 0 day of treatment and was
              significantly lower in the transgenic lines than in the WT. The
              ABA content in the transgenic lines was significantly higher than
              that in the WT. The CsPLD$\alpha$ overexpression could increase
              the osmolyte content and reduce the ion leakage. The proline,
              soluble sugar, and soluble protein contents significantly
              increased. By contrast, the electrolytic leakage and
              malondialdehyde accumulation in leaves significantly decreased.
              The shoot and root fresh and dry weights of the overexpression
              lines significantly increased. These results indicated that a
              significant correlation between CsPLD$\alpha$ overexpression and
              improved resistance to water deficit. CONCLUSIONS: The plants
              with overexpressed CsPLD$\alpha$ exhibited lower water loss,
              higher leaf relative water content, and heavier fresh and dry
              matter accumulation than the WT. We proposed that CsPLD$\alpha$
              was involved in the ABA-dependent pathway in mediating the
              stomatal closure and preventing the elevation of intracellular
              solute potential.",

              Casparian band, and the majority of angiosperm roots tested also
              have an exodermis with a Casparian band. Both the endodermis and
              exodermis may develop suberin lamellae and thick, tertiary walls.
              Each of these wall modifications has its own function(s). The
              endodermal Casparian band prevents the unimpeded movement of
              apoplastic substances into the stele and also prevents the
              backflow of ions that have moved into the stele symplastically
              and then were released into its apoplast. In roots with a mature
              exodermis, the barrier to apoplastic inflow of ions occurs near
              the root surface, but prevention of backflow of ions from the
              stele remains a function of the endodermis. The suberin lamellae
              protect against pathogen invasion and possibly root drying during
              times of stress. Tertiary walls of the endodermis and exodermis
              are believed to function in mechanical support of the root, but
              this idea remains to be tested. During stress, root growth rates
              decline, and the endodermis and exodermis develop closer to the
              root tip. In two cases, stress is known to induce the formation
              of an exodermis, and in several other cases to accelerate the
              development of both the exodermis and endodermis. The responses

              whole-plant functional-structural model, and was calibrated on
              two varieties, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. The model
              captured well the variations in growth and sugar accumulation
              caused by environmental conditions, changes in leaf-to-fruit

              capacity can reverse berry shrinkage. Sensitivity analysis
              highlighted the importance of phloem hydraulic conductance, sugar

  abstract = "Current land surface models assume that groundwater, streamflow
              and plant transpiration are all sourced and mediated by the same
              well mixed water reservoir--the soil. However, recent work in
              Oregon and Mexico has shown evidence of ecohydrological
              separation, whereby different subsurface compartmentalized pools
              of water supply either plant transpiration fluxes or the combined
              fluxes of groundwater and streamflow. These findings have not yet
              been widely tested. Here we use hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data

              47 globally distributed sites to show that ecohydrological
              separation is widespread across different biomes. Precipitation,
              stream water and groundwater from each site plot approximately
              along the $\delta$(2)H/$\delta$(18)O slope of local precipitation

              sites all plot below the local stream water and groundwater on
              the meteoric water line, suggesting that plants use soil water
              that does not itself contribute to groundwater recharge or
              streamflow. Our results further show that, at 80\% of the sites,

              carbon metabolism is impacted by rising CO2 concentrations and
              temperatures, but also feeds back onto the climate system to help
              determine the trajectory of future climate change. Here we review
              how photosynthesis, photorespiration and respiration are affected
              by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate warming,
              both separately and in combination. We also compile data from the
              literature on plants grown at multiple temperatures, focusing on
              net CO2 assimilation rates and leaf dark respiration rates
              measured at the growth temperature (Agrowth and Rgrowth ,
              respectively). Our analyses show that the ratio of Agrowth to
              Rgrowth is generally homeostatic across a wide range of species
              and growth temperatures, and that species that have reduced
              Agrowth at higher growth temperatures also tend to have reduced
              Rgrowth , while species that show stimulations in Agrowth under
              warming tend to have higher Rgrowth in the hotter environment.
              These results highlight the need to study these physiological
              processes together to better predict how vegetation carbon

              carbon fluxes in the root, including exudation, respiration, and
              root content, were measured continuously over the next 20 h
              concurrently with (14)C efflux from the leaf. Immediately after
              the end of the (14)CO(2) pulse, (14)C activity was detected in
              the root, the hydroponic solution, and in root respiration. The
              rate of (14)C exudation from the root was maximal after 2 to 3 h,
              and declined to one-third of maximum after a further 5 h.
              Completion of the rapid phase of (14)C efflux from the leaf
              coincided with peak (14)C exudation rate. Thus, exudation flux is
              much more rapidly and dynamically coupled to current
              photosynthesis than has been appreciated. Careful
              cross-calibration of (14)C counting methods allowed a dynamic
              (14)C budget to be constructed for the root. Cumulative (14)C
              exudation after 20 h was around 3\% of (14)C fixed in
              photosynthesis. Partitioning of photosynthate between shoot and
              root was manipulated by partial defoliation before applying the
              (14)CO(2) pulse to the remaining intact leaf. Although the rate

              and exuded from the root was substantially reduced. This clearly

              considered by mapping the 3D position and orientation of more
              than 26 000 leaves in an apple tree. Four published models for
              canopy radiation interception, energy budget of leaves and mines,
              body temperature and developmental rate of the leaf miner were
              integrated. Model predictions were compared with actual
              microclimate temperatures. The biophysical model accurately
              predicted temperature within mines at different positions within
              the tree crown. 3. Field temperature measurements indicated that
              leaf and mine temperature patterns differ according to the
              regional climatic conditions (cloudy or sunny) and depending on
              their location within the canopy. Mines in the sun can be warmer

              sieve tubes exhibited a diurnal cycle of sucrose concentrations
              and fluxes in phloem sap. Data from many tansy plants indicated
              an increased sucrose flux in the phloem during daytime in case of
              low N-nutrition, not at high N-nutrition. The sucrose
              concentration in phloem sap of young Ricinus plants changed
              marginally between day and night, whereas the sucrose flux
              increased 1.5-fold during daytime (but not in old Ricinus
              plants). The amino acid concentrations and fluxes in tansy sieve
              tubes exhibited a similar diurnal cycle as the sucrose
              concentrations and fluxes, including their dependence on

  abstract  = "[Dry matter partitioning is the end result of the flow of
               assimilates from source organs via a transport path to the sink
               organs. The dry matter partitioning among the sinks of a plant
               is primarily regulated by the sinks themselves. The effect of
               source strength on dry matter partitioning is often not a direct
               one, but indirect via the formation of sink organs. Although the
               translocation rate of assimilates may depend on the transport
               path, the transport path is only of minor importance for the
               regulation of dry matter partitioning at the whole plant level.
               To understand the regulation of dry matter partitioning by the
               sinks, a parameter like sink strength is needed that describes a
               sink's ability to influence assimilate import and is independent
               of the rest of the plant. The term sink strength can be defined
               as the competitive ability of an organ to attract assimilates.
               However, there is much debate and confusion about the term sink
               strength because this term is often not clearly defined. Sink
               strength has been proposed to be the product of sink size and
               sink activity. Although cell number is often considered as a
               suitable measure of sink size, it appears not always to be an
               important determinant of sink size. Moreover, sink strength may
               depend on sink age rather than sink size. A model for dry matter
               partitioning into generative plant parts, which is based on sink
               strengths of the organs, is described. The potential growth rate
               (potential capacity to accumulate assimilates) has been shown to
               be an important parameter that quantitatively reflects the sink
               strength of an organ. The potential growth rates of the plant's
               organs are not static but change dynamically. The potential
               growth rate of a fruit is a function of both its age and
               temperature. For several crops it has been shown that the dry
               matter partitioning into an organ can be quantitatively
               described as a function of its potential growth rate relative to
               that of the other plant organs.]",

              to shape development and metabolism. Accordingly, plant growth is
              well correlated with light interception and energy conversion
              through photosynthesis. Because water deficits close stomata and
              thus reduce C entry, it has been hypothesised that droughted
              plants are under C starvation and their growth under C
              limitation. In this review, these points are questioned by
              combining literature review with experimental and modelling
              illustrations in various plant organs and species. First,
              converging evidence is gathered from the literature that water
              deficit generally increases C concentration in plant organs. The
              hypothesis is raised that this could be due to organ expansion
              (as a major C sink) being affected earlier and more intensively
              than photosynthesis (C source) and metabolism. How such an
              increase is likely to interact with C signalling is not known.
              Hence, the literature is reviewed for possible links between C
              and stress signalling that could take part in this interaction.
              Finally, the possible impact of water deficit-induced C
              accumulation on growth is questioned for various sink organs of
              several species by combining published as well as new
              experimental data or data generated using a modelling approach.
              To this aim, robust correlations between C availability and sink
              organ growth are reported in the absence of water deficit. Under
              water deficit, relationships weaken or are modified suggesting
              release of the influence of C availability on sink organ growth.
              These results are interpreted as the signature of a transition
              from source to sink growth limitation under water deficit.",

              metabolism and growth when they are unable to photosynthesise.
              This storage can be in leaves and other green tissues, where it
              is degraded during the night, or in heterotrophic tissues such as
              roots, seeds and tubers, where it is stored over longer time
              periods. Arabidopsis accumulates starch in many of its tissues,
              but mostly in its leaves during the day. It has proven to be a
              powerful genetic system for discovering how starch is synthesised
              and degraded, and new proteins and processes have been
              discovered. Such work has major significance for our starch
              crops, whose yield and quality could be improved by the
              application of this knowledge. Research into Arabidopsis starch

              time and are initially depleted in surface soil strata, root

              variable fluorescence, stomata density, soluble carbohydrate
              content) were studied in a comparative way in sun and shade
              leaves of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and in high-light and low-light
              seedlings. 1. Sun leaves of the beech possess a smaller leaf
              area, higher dry weight, lower water content, higher stomata
              density, higher chlorophyll a/b ratios and are thicker than the
              shade leaves. Sun leaves on the average contain more chlorophyll
              in a leaf area unit; the shade leaf exhibits more chlorophyll on
              a dry weight basis. Sun leaves show higher rates for dark
              respiration and a higher light saturation of photosynthetic
              CO2-fixation. Above 2000 lux they are more efficient in
              photosynthetic quantum conversion than the shade leaves. 2. The
              development of HL-radish plants proceeds much faster than that of
              LL-plants. The cotyledons of HL-plants show a higher dry weight,
              lower water content, a higher ratio of chlorophyll a/b and a
              higher gross photosynthesis rate than the cotyledons of the
              LL-plants, which possess a higher chlorophyll content per dry
              weight basis. The large area of the HL-cotyledon on the one hand,
              as well as the higher stomata density and the higher respiration
              rate in the LL-cotyledon on the other hand, are not in agreement
              with the characteristics of sun and shade leaves respectively. 3.
              The development, growth and wilting of wheat leaves and the
              appearance of the following leaves (leaf succession) is much
              faster at high quanta fluence rates than in weak light. The
              chlorophyll content is higher in the HL-leaf per unit leaf area
              and in the LL-leaf per g dry weight. There are no differences in
              the stomata density and leaf area between the HL- and LL-leaf.
              There are fewer differences between HL- and LL-leaves than in
              beech or radish leaves. 4. The chloroplast ultrastructure of
              shade-type chloroplasts (shade leaves, LL-leaves) is not only
              characterized by a much higher number of thylakoids per granum
              and a higher stacking degree of thylakoids, but also by broader
              grana than in sun-type chloroplasts (sun leaves, HL-leaves). The
              chloroplasts of sun leaves and of HL-leaves exhibit large starch
              grains. 5. Shade leaves and LL-leaves exhibit a higher maximum
              chlorophyll fluorescence and it takes more time for the
              fluorescence to decline to the steady state than in sun and
              HL-leaves. The variable fluorescence VF (ratio of fluorescence
              decrease to steady state fluorescence) is always higher in the
              sun and HL-leaf of the same physiological stage (maximum
              chlorophyll content of the leaf) than in the shade and LL-leaf.
              The fluorescence emission spectra of sun and HL-leaves show a
              higher proportion of chlorophyli fluorescence in the second
              emission maximum F2 than shade and LL-leaves. 6. The level of
              soluble carbohydrates (reducing sugars) is significantly higher
              in sun and HL-leaves than in shade and LL-leaves and even
              reflects changes in the amounts of the daily incident light. 7.
              Some but not all characteristics of mature sun and shade leaves
              are found in HL- and LL-leaves of seedlings. Leaf thickness, dry
              weight, chlorophyll content, soluble carbohydrate level,
              photosynthetic CO2-fixation, height and width of grana stacks and
              starch content, are good parameters to describe the differences
              between LL- and HL-leaves; with some reservations concerning age
              and physiological stage of leaf, a/b ratios, chlorophyll content
              per leaf area unit and the variable fluorescence are also

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: AmapSim is a tool that implements a
              structural plant growth model based on a botanical theory and
              simulates plant morphogenesis to produce accurate, complex and
              detailed plant architectures. This software is the result of more
              than a decade of research and development devoted to plant
              architecture. New advances in the software development have
              yielded plug-in external functions that open up the simulator to
              functional processes. METHODS: The simulation of plant topology
              is based on the growth of a set of virtual buds whose activity is
              modelled using stochastic processes. The geometry of the
              resulting axes is modelled by simple descriptive functions. The
              potential growth of each bud is represented by means of a
              numerical value called physiological age, which controls the
              value for each parameter in the model. The set of possible values
              for physiological ages is called the reference axis. In order to
              mimic morphological and architectural metamorphosis, the value
              allocated for the physiological age of buds evolves along this
              reference axis according to an oriented finite state automaton
              whose occupation and transition law follows a semi-Markovian
              function. KEY RESULTS: Simulations were performed on tomato
              plants to demonstrate how the AmapSim simulator can interface
              external modules, e.g. a GREENLAB growth model and a radiosity
              model. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithmic ability provided by AmapSim,
              e.g. the reference axis, enables unified control to be exercised
              over plant development parameter values, depending on the
              biological process target: how to affect the local pertinent
              process, i.e. the pertinent parameter(s), while keeping the rest
              unchanged. This opening up to external functions also offers a
              broadened field of applications and thus allows feedback between
              plant growth and the physical environment.",

              Rold{\'a}n-Ruiz, Isabel and Steppe, Kathy",
  abstract = "Background and Aims: In many scenarios the availability of
              assimilated carbon is not the constraining factor of plant
              growth. Rather, organ growth appears driven by sink activity in
              which water availability plays a determinant role. Current
              functional-structural plant models (FSPMs) mainly focus on
              plant-carbon relations and largely disregard the importance of
              plant water status in organogenesis. Consequently, incorporating
              a turgor-driven growth concept, coupling carbon and water
              dynamics in an FSPM, presents a significant improvement towards
              capturing plant development in a more mechanistic manner.
              Methods: An existing process-based water flow and storage model
              served as a basis for implementing water control in FSPMs. Its
              concepts were adjusted to the scale of individual plant organs
              and interwoven with the basic principles of modelling carbon
              dynamics to allow evaluation of turgor pressure across the entire
              plant. This was then linked to plant organ growth by applying the
              principles of the widely used Lockhart equation. Key results:
              This model successfully integrates a mechanistic understanding of
              plant water transport dynamics coupled with simple carbon
              dynamics within a dynamically developing plant architecture. It
              allows evaluation of turgor pressure on the scale of plant
              organs, resulting in clear diel and long-term patterns, directly
              linked to plant organ growth. Conclusions: A conceptual sap flow
              and turgor-driven growth model was introduced for
              functional-structural plant modelling. It is applicable to any
              plant architecture and allows visual exploration of the diel
              patterns of organ water content and growth. Integrated in
              existing FSPMs, this new concept fosters an array of
              possibilities for FSPMs, as it presents a different formulation
              of growth in terms of local processes, influenced by local and

              flow into broad-leaved forests where characteristics of stand
              structure, surface roughness, leaf dimension, and aerodynamic and
              canopy conductance may interact to partially decouple the canopy
              from the atmosphere. The implications of this partial decoupling
              to understanding the environmental control of canopy
              transpiration and to the modeling of forest water use are many.
              Therefore, thermal dissipation probes were used over a
              three-month period (June through August, 1997) to quantify
              day-to-day and tree-to-tree variation in whole-tree sap flow (Q)
              for 12 red maple (Acerrubrum L.) trees growing in an upland oak
              forest of eastern Tennessee. Whole-tree Q was calculated as the
              product of measured sap velocity, sapwood area and the fraction
              of sapwood functional in water transport. Daily canopy
              transpiration (Ec) was calculated from whole-tree Q and projected
              crown area, whereas average daily conductance (gc) was derived by
              inverting the Penman--Monteith equation. Maximum Q averaged 73kg
              per tree per day and varied between 45 and 160kg per day for
              trees that ranged in stem diameter (DBH) from 17 to 35cm, and
              from 19 to 26m in height. Canopy transpiration peaked at 3.0mm
              per day in early July and averaged 1.5mm per day over the 3-month
              measurement period. Tree-to-tree variability for Ec was high.
              Maximum rates of Ec varied from 1.9mm per day for the tree with
              the smallest projected crown area to 5.7mm per day for one of the
              largest trees. Day-to-day variation in Ec was a function of daily
              differences in net radiation (Rn) and atmospheric humidity
              deficit ($\delta$e). Increases in daily Rn and $\delta$e led to
              linear increases in canopy transpiration and there was no
              indication that a plateau-style relationship existed between Ec
              and average daily $\delta$e. Mean daily gc ranged from 1.4 to
              6.7mms−1, and averaged 3.4mms−1 across the 12 study trees. Some
              of the tree-to-tree variation observed for Ec and gc was related
              to the fact that not all trees occupied the same vertical
              position within the stand. Variation in estimates of the daily
              decoupling coefficient (0$\leq$$\Omega$$\leq$1) was also
              considerable and for individual trees the seasonally-averaged
              $\Omega$ varied from 0.12 to 0.37, and averaged 0.23 for the 12
              study trees. An $\Omega$ of this magnitude indicates that red
              maple canopies are partially decoupled from the atmosphere and
              suggests that significant vertical gradients of air temperature
              and $\delta$e from the canopy surface to the bulk air several
              meters above the canopy are possible. Model analysis of hourly
              data indicated that simulated surface temperatures in mid-July
              were 3.6--5.8°C higher than above-canopy reference temperatures,
              and $\delta$e at the canopy surface was 0.3kPa higher than that
              of the bulk atmosphere. These calculations were partially
              supported by leaf-level measurements taken on one of the trees
              from a 20-m canopy-access tower. The implications of this partial
              decoupling to understanding and modeling the environmental

  abstract = "Trees present a critical challenge to long-distance transport
              because as a tree grows in height and the transport pathway
              increases in length, the hydraulic resistance of the vascular
              tissue should increase. This has led many to question whether
              trees can rely on a passive transport mechanism to move
              carbohydrates from their leaves to their roots. Although species
              that actively load sugars into their phloem, such as vines and
              herbs, can increase the driving force for transport as they
              elongate, it is possible that many trees cannot generate high
              turgor pressures because they do not use transporters to load
              sugar into the phloem. Here, we examine how trees can maintain
              efficient carbohydrate transport as they grow taller by analysing
              sieve tube anatomy, including sieve plate geometry, using

              measuring the turgor pressures in the leaves of a tall tree in

              mature red oak tree. These pressures are of sufficient magnitude
              to drive phloem transport only in concert with structural changes
              in the phloem that reduce transport resistance. As a result, the

               at the microscopic scale and especially the effect on root water
               uptake is not yet assessed in such models. In this study, an
               analytical approach describing the hydraulic conductivity drop
               from the bulk soil to the soil--root interface for a
               three-dimensional plant-scale model was derived and validated by
               numerical means. With these tools, quantification of the local
               hydraulic conductivity drop with time was possible. Furthermore,
               the effect of the hydraulic conductivity drop on the time
               occurrence of plant stress was evaluated. Root water uptake was
               assessed, with and without considering the hydraulic
               conductivity drop around single roots in a three-dimensional
               plant-scale model in terms of total water uptake at the root
               collar under different soil and root properties. It was shown

              trees can rely on a passive transport mechanism to move
              carbohydrates from their leaves to their roots. Although species

              its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e.
              symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely
              passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into
              larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped),

              irreversible growth. The contribution of different stem tissues
              to the overall SDV signal is currently under debate and shows
              variation with species and plant age, but can be investigated by
              combining SDV with state-of-the-art technology like magnetic
              resonance imaging. Various physiological mechanisms, such as
              water and carbon transport, and mechanical properties influence
              the SDV pattern, making it an extensive source of information on
              dynamic plant behaviour. To unravel these dynamics and to extract
              information on plant physiology or plant biophysics from SDV,
              mechanistic modelling has proved to be valuable. Biophysical
              models integrate different mechanisms underlying SDV, and help us
              to explain the resulting SDV signal. Using an elementary
              modelling approach, we demonstrate the application of SDV as a
              tool to examine plant water relations, plant hydraulics, plant
              carbon relations, plant nutrition, freezing effects, plant
              phenology and dendroclimatology. In the ever-expanding SDV
              knowledge base we identified two principal research tracks.
              First, in detailed short-term experiments, SDV measurements are
              combined with other plant measurements and modelling to discover
              patterns in phloem turgor, phloem osmotic concentrations, root
              pressure and plant endogenous control. Second, long-term SDV time
              series covering many different species, regions and climates
              provide an expanding amount of phenotypic data of growth,
              phenology and survival in relation to microclimate, soil water
              availability, species or genotype, which can be coupled with
              genetic information to support ecological and breeding research
              under on-going global change. This under-exploited source of
              information has now encouraged research groups to set up
              coordinated initiatives to explore this data pool via global
              analysis techniques and data-mining.",

              their importance in plant establishment and because they provide
              a simple source and sink model of phloem transport. The
              dye-tracing method uses a photodiode to track the movement of a
              bleach front of fluorescent dye traveling in the phloem from the
              cotyledons (source) to the roots (sink). During early seedling
              development, phloem transport velocity in this direction can
              change 2-fold depending on vascular connectivity and the number
              of actively growing sinks. Prior to leaf expansion, vascular
              bundles attached to the first developing leaf demonstrate a
              decline in basipetal phloem transport that can be alleviated by
              the leaf's removal. At this stage, seedlings appear carbon

              transitions to a carbon source, seedling growth rate increases
              and basipetal phloem transport velocity becomes more stable.
              Because bundles appear to operate autonomously, transport
              velocity can differ among vascular bundles. Together, these

              by osmotically induced pressure gradients between source organs
              (high turgor) and sink organs (lower turgor). Two crucial
              components of M{\"u}nch's hypothesis, the translocation by mass
              flow from sources to sinks and the osmotic mechanism of pressure
              flow, were established notions at the time, but had been
              developed by two institutionally separated groups of scholars. A
              conceptual separation of whole-plant biology from cellular
              physiology had followed the institutional separation of forestry
              science from botany in German-speaking central Europe during the
              so-called Humboldtian reforms, and was reinforced by the delayed
              institutionalization of plant physiology as an academic
              discipline. M{\"u}nch did not invent a novel concept, but
              accomplished an integration of the organism-focused and the
              cell-focused research traditions, reducing the polarization that
              had evolved when research universities emerged in central Europe.
              Post-M{\"u}nch debates about the validity of his hypothesis

              sugars from regions of synthesis (mature leaves) to sugar sinks
              (roots, fruits). In this process, known as M{\"u}nch pressure
              flow, the loading of sugars from photosynthetic cells to the
              export conduit (the phloem) is crucial, as it sets the pressure
              head necessary to power long-distance transport. Whereas most
              herbaceous plants use active mechanisms to increase phloem sugar
              concentration above that of the photosynthetic cells, in most
              tree species, for which transport distances are largest, loading
              seems, counterintuitively, to occur by means of passive
              symplastic diffusion from the mesophyll to the phloem. Here, we
              use a synthetic microfluidic model of a passive loader to explore
              the non-linear dynamics that arise during export and determine
              the ability of passive loading to drive long-distance transport.
              We first demonstrate that in our device, the phloem concentration
              is set by the balance between the resistances to diffusive
              loading from the source and convective export through the phloem.
              Convection-limited export corresponds to classical models of
              M{\"u}nch transport, where the phloem concentration is close to
              that of the source; in contrast, diffusion-limited export leads
              to small phloem concentrations and weak scaling of flow rates
              with hydraulic resistance. We then show that the effective regime
              of convection-limited export is predominant in plants with large
              transport resistances and low xylem pressures. Moreover,
              hydrostatic pressures developed in our synthetic passive loader
              can reach botanically relevant values as high as 10 bars. We
              conclude that passive loading is sufficient to drive
              long-distance transport in large plants, and that trees are well
              suited to take full advantage of passive phloem loading

                 knowledge, this is the first transport model that provides
                 continuous distributions of the system variables in a complex
                 developing structure. The model takes into account non-linear
                 dependence of phloem resistance and osmotic potential on the
                 local carbohydrate concentration. The model solutions show
                 excellent agreement with the existing results of other
                 analytical and numerical models. These comparisons confirm the
                 validity of the approximations made in the model. Combining
                 analytical and computational methods made it possible to take
                 into account continuous sink/source distribution within
                 internodes without much increase in the complexity of the
                 computational procedure, because the necessary changes in the
                 model were mostly in the analytical part. The results
                 emphasize sensitivity of phloem flux and lateral xylem flux to
                 the presence of distributed sinks and sources along the
                 transport system.ConclusionsThe presented approach provides a
                 new insight into mechanistic modelling of phloem/xylem
                 transport in growing plants. It will be useful for both
                 fine-scale modelling of carbohydrate dynamics and for creating
                 simpler models at a growth unit level.",

              phloem vascular system is driven by osmotic pressure gradients,
              his hypothesis has been strongly supported by evidence from
              herbaceous angiosperms. Experimental constraints made it
              difficult to test this proposal in large trees, where the
              distance between source and sink might prove incompatible with
              the hypothesis. Recently, the theoretical optimization of the
              M{\"u}nch mechanism was shown to lead to surprisingly simple
              predictions for the dimensions of the phloem sieve elements in
              relation to that of fast growing angiosperms. These results can
              be obtained in a very transparent way using a simple coupled
              resistor model. To test the universality of the M{\"u}nch
              mechanism, we compiled anatomical data for 32 angiosperm and 38
              gymnosperm trees with heights spanning 0.1-50 m. The species
              studied showed a remarkable correlation with the scaling

              element conductivity and predicting phloem sap flow velocity. The
              central finding of this work is that all vascular plants seem to
              have evolved efficient osmotic pumping units, despite their huge
              disparity in size and morphology. This contribution extends the

              framework for simulating annual long-term carbohydrate storage

              this problem using empirical field data and details of structural
              components of simulated trees to estimate the total carbohydrate
              stored over a dormant season and available for mobilization
              during spring budbreak. METHODS: The seasonal patterns of
              mobilization and storage of non-structural carbohydrates in bark
              and wood of the scion and rootstock crowns of the trunks of peach
              (Prunus persica) trees were analysed subsequent to treatments
              designed to maximize differences in source-sink behaviour during
              the growing season. Mature peach trees received one of three
              treatments (defruited and no pruning, severe pruning to 1·0 m,
              and unthinned with no pruning) in late winter, just prior to
              budbreak. Selected trees of each treatment were harvested at four
              times (March, June, August and November) and slices of trunk and
              root crown tissue above and below the graft union were removed
              for carbohydrate analysis. Inner bark and xylem tissues from the
              first to fifth rings were separated and analysed for
              non-structural carbohydrates. Data from these experiments were
              then used to estimate the amount of non-structural carbohydrates
              available for mobilization and to parameterize a carbohydrate
              storage sub-model in the functional-structural L-PEACH model. KEY
              RESULTS: The mass fraction of carbohydrates in all sample tissues
              decreased from March to June, but the decrease was greatest in
              the severely pruned and unthinned treatments. November
              carbohydrate mass fractions in all tissues recovered to values
              similar to those in the previous March, except in the older xylem
              rings of the severely pruned and unthinned treatment.
              Carbohydrate storage sink capacity in trunks was empirically
              estimated from the mean maximum measured trunk non-structural
              carbohydrate mass fractions. The carbohydrate storage source
              available for mobilization was estimated from these maximum mass
              fractions and the early summer minimum mass fractions remaining
              in these tissues in the severe treatments that maximized
              mobilization of stored carbohydrates. The L-PEACH sink-source
              carbohydrate distribution framework was then used along with
              simulated tree structure to successfully simulate annual
              carbohydrate storage sink and source behaviour over years.
              CONCLUSIONS: The sink-source concept of carbohydrate distribution
              within a tree was extended to include winter carbohydrate storage
              and spring mobilization by considering the storage sink and
              source as a function of the collective capacity of active xylem
              and phloem tissue of the tree, and its annual behaviour was
              effectively simulated using the L-PEACH functional-structural

              studying root water extraction by mature root systems from the
              single root to the whole root system scale and (ii) providing
              experimental data for the assessment of a detailed model of water
              transport in the soil--root system presented in a companion paper
              (Doussan et al., Plant Soil 2006, this issue). Based on the

              the influence of root system architecture and soil hydraulic
              properties on water uptake. We worked with narrow-leaf lupin
              plants whose root system architecture ranged from taprooted to
              fasciculate. Plants were grown in large thin containers
              (rhizotron) filled with a translucent sand/clay mix growing
              medium. Water transfer in the soil, together with root water
              uptake, were monitored in laboratory experiments by means of 2D
              light transmission imaging. This technique enables the mapping of
              the soil water content at high spatial and temporal resolutions.
              Throughout water uptake events, we clearly observed and
              quantified the formation and movement of a water extraction front
              and of high gradients of soil water content next to the roots.
              The data obtained also demonstrate that water uptake is never
              restricted to a specific portion of a root and that the

              generally set on deep roots, expected to improve access to soil

              quantitative understanding of the role of RSA in the uptake of

              there is a need for plant biologists and hydrologists to develop
              together their understanding of water movement in the soil--plant

              uptake is hardly separable from the hydraulic properties of the

Existing models suggest that partitioning is controlled by the potential sink strength. They cannot, however, simulate hierarchical uptake other than by using absolute priorities. Moreover, they cannot explain that the changes in photoassimilate partitioning result from changes in photosynthesis. In this paper we present a model of phloem sieve circulation, based on the model of Minchin et al . ( Journal of Experimental Botany44 : 947–955, 1993). The root system was represented by a network of segments to which meristems were connected. The properties of the segments were determined by the differentiation stage. Photoassimilate import from each organ was assumed to be limited by a metabolic process and driven by Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The axial growth was proportional to meristem respiration, which drives the flux of new cells required for root elongation. We used the model to look at trophic apical dominance, determinate and indeterminate root growth, the effect of the activity of a root on competition with its neighbours, and the effect of photoassimilate availability on changes in partitioning. The simulated phloem mass flow yielded results of the same order of magnitude as those generally reported in the literature. For the main well vascularized axis, the model predicted that one single apical meristem larger than its neighbouring laterals, was enough to generate a taprooted system. Conversely, when the meristem of laterals close to the collar had a volume similar to that of the taproot, the predicted network became fibrous. The model predicted a hierarchical priority for organ photoassimilate uptake, similar to that described in the literature, during the decline in photosynthetic activity. Our model suggests that determinate growth of the first laterals resulted from a local shortage of photoassimilate at their meristem, as a result of the limited transport properties of the developed roots.

              conductivity and soil hydraulic conductivity were shown to
              control the plant water extraction distribution. Highly
              conductive soils promote water uptake but at the same time
              decrease the variability of the soil water content. A large
              radial root conductivity increases the amount of water extracted
              by the root and generates very heterogeneous water extraction
              profiles. Increasing the xylem conductivity has less impact
              because the xylem is generally the most conductive part of the
              system. It was also determined that, due to the different
              magnitudes of soil and root conductivities, similar

              water content and flux distributions at the plant scale.

              which increases the number of growing tips and distributes their
              growth potential within the whole root system. METHODS: Using a
              method presented in a recent paper, the defined branching traits
              were estimated in 140 different species, and the branching
              patterns of monocots (45 species) and dicots (95 species) were
              compared. KEY RESULTS: It was checked that the method also
              applied to monocots (not considered in the previous paper), and
              that all traits could be estimated in each species. Variations of
              most traits were even larger for monocots than for dicots.
              Systematic differences appeared between these two groups:
              monocots tended to have a larger range in apical diameters
              (stronger heterorhizy), with both finer and thicker roots; the
              diameters of their lateral roots were also more variable; their
              roots exerted a stronger dominance over lateral branches.
              Altogether, species exhibited two main dependencies among their
              traits that were illustrated using two axes: (1) the
              'fineness-density' axis separated the species which develop very
              fine roots and branch densely, from species without fine roots
              which space out their branches; and (2) the
              'dominance-heterorhizy' axis separated the species according to
              the range in their apical diameter which was positively
              correlated to the level of dominance of mother roots over their
              branches. Both axes and correlations were remarkably similar for
              monocots and dicots. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the overall typology,

              species in natura, at two sites, each presenting homogeneous soil
              conditions. We estimated for each species and site a set of five
              traits used for the modelling of the root system architecture:
              extreme tip diameters (Dmin and Dmax), relative diameter range
              (Drange), mean inter-branch distance (IBD) and dominance slope
              between the diameters of parent and lateral roots (DlDm). Key
              Results: The five traits presented a highly significant species
              effect, explaining between 77 and 98 \% of the total variation.
              Dmin, Dmax and Drange were particularly determined by the

              that together accounted for 84 \% of the variations observed.

              were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum)
              and maize (Zea mays). Semi-Markov switching linear models were
              used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate
              profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with
              similar characteristics in both species. The first type
              corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly
              arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots
              cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots
              were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant
              affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type
              was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover,
              the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a
              ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential
              dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the
              primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov
              chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward
              neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random
              branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved,
              despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our
              phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic
              variability of lateral root developmental patterns.",

  abstract = "Pearl millet plays an important role for food security in arid
              regions of Africa and India. Nevertheless, it is considered an
              orphan crop as it lags far behind other cereals in terms of
              genetic improvement efforts. Breeding pearl millet varieties with
              improved root traits promises to deliver benefits in water and
              nutrient acquisition. Here, we characterize early pearl millet
              root system development using several different root phenotyping
              approaches that include rhizotrons and microCT. We report that
              early stage pearl millet root system development is characterized
              by a fast growing primary root that quickly colonizes deeper soil
              horizons. We also describe root anatomical studies that revealed
              three distinct types of lateral roots that form on both primary
              roots and crown roots. Finally, we detected significant variation
              for two root architectural traits, primary root lenght and
              lateral root density, in pearl millet inbred lines. This study
              provides the basis for subsequent genetic experiments to identify
              loci associated with interesting early root development traits in
              this important cereal.",
